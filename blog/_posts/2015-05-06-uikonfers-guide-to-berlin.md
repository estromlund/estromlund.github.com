title: UIKonfer's Guide to Berlin
---

I couldn't be more excited to attend [UIKonf](https://www.uikonf.com), Berlin's "independent conference for serious iOS developers", which will take place May 17-20, 2015.

Since so many attendees will be visiting from cities outside of Berlin or even Europe, I wanted to write a quick blog post with a few tips from the perspective of someone who moved from San Francisco in February 2014, and who now is proud to call Berlin my home.

### Language

Most people speak English, this should not be a problem. Either way, learning a few phrases from Duolingo goes a long way.

### Money

Have cash on you at all times. Most places do not take credit cards of any kind. If you have Bank of America, it is free to take cash out at Deutsche Bank ATMs.

### Weather

It is spring time here in Berlin, and that means the weather is warm, muggy, and rainy. Often at the same time. Bring warm weather clothes and a rain jacket, but be prepared for random cold days and nights.

### Getting around

Berlin is really easy to get around. Walking and public transportation are the easiest, and you can use Google Maps or any other transit app to find your connections. Taxis are also available everywhere, but public transportation is cheaper and often just as fast.

For public transportation, you will only need to buy one ticket (currently 2.70 Euro) for the S-Bahn (above ground train), U-Bahn (subway) or tram/metro (street car) within the main parts of Berlin. This is good for 120 minutes *in one direction*. Make sure to buy another ticket for your return trip, even if within the 2 hour window.

For S-Bahn and U-Bahn, you need to purchase a ticket at the station **and then validate it** before getting on the train. For the tram/metro, you can buy tickets onboard.

Tickets are checked randomly by undercover ticket inspectors. You will often not be checked, but if you are, and don't have a ticket, you will be fined 40 Euro. The fine can paid on the spot or a bill mailed to you.

*Note that there have been strikes in the last few months, which means the S-Bahn is shut down from time to time. Check the [BVG](http://www.bvg.de/en/) website for real-time updates, including transport options when closures are in effect.*

### Eating

Berlin has a very international food scene. That said, there are a few German specialties that I recommend trying:

- Schnitzel: You probably know this one. It's (typically) pork, hammered thin, breaded and fried. Usually served with Bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes), or potato salad. Note: *wiener*schnitzel is a specific kind of schnitzel from Vienna and is made from veal. There are many other kinds of schnitzel. Try them all :)

- Currywurst: A specialty from Berlin, this is basically a bratwurst (sausage), cut up then covered with a curry-ketchup sauce. Often served with french fries ("pommes").

- Döner: This Turkish specialty is as Turkish as the burrito is Mexican. It is found everywhere, and is typically best eaten after 2am.

- Spargel (asparagus): UIKonf is right in the middle of Spargel season, which, yes, is [a thing](http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/seasonal-recipes-may-2013/). I suggest trying a dish with the white asparagus ("weißer Spargel") -- typically this is served wrapped in ham, next to potatoes, and all coated in hollandaise sauce. What's not to like?!

Beyond these, you can also eat pretty much any food in Berlin (except good Mexican food). In fact, sometimes it can be hard to find a good "German" meal in Berlin.

### Drinking

Welcome to the beer capital of the world. Beer in Berlin is everywhere, and cheap! You will typically get beers at a restaurant (around 3-4 Euro for 0.5L), or a Späti (24/7 hole-in-the-wall shops which sell, among other things, beer, typically around 1-3 Euro).

#### German Beers

The typical German beer is a pilsner and various brands will be on tap at nearly every bar (try Augustiner, Becks, or the new, no-brand "Bier"). If you're not a fan, or get tired of the ubiquitous pilsner, you can also try the Hefeweizens (wheat beers), Schwarzbiers (black beers), and...that's about it for German beers.

#### Craft Beers

Unfortunately, you won't find ales or IPAS at most bars. However, Berlin does have a [blossoming craft brew scene](http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/berlins-craft-beer-scene/), and a few places will carry other types of beers. I highly recommend checking out [Vagabund](http://www.vagabundbrauerei.com/), a crowd-funded craft brewery in the Wedding neighborhood. Additionally, bars such as [Badfish](http://www.badfishbarberlin.com/) and [Kaschk](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kaschk-berlin) will usually carry a few IPAs and tasty non-German-style beers.

#### Beer Gardens

Though more prominent in southern Germany, biergartens are also a staple of Berlin. If you have a chance, go spend some time in one (my favorite is [Prater](http://www.pratergarten.de/e/index.php)), buy a beer, and enjoy the sunshine.

I should also note that you are allowed to drink outside, so grab a beer and enjoy it in a park or wherever you want. If you're like me, you'll do this right away and feel like a rebel, then realize no one cares :)

### Paying

If you sit down to eat somewhere, you will have to ask for the check when you are ready to go. The server will come to you and collect money from each person. Tipping is generally around 10%, which usually means rounding up to the nearest Euro for small checks. When paying, tell the server the total (including tip) -- "Make it 8 please". Don't try and give the tip afterwards, like we do in the US, because it will just get awkward.

### History

Berlin, and Germany in general, is full of history spanning many different eras. It has been rebuilt numerous times, and just united as one city in 1989. In fact, Berlin is still blossoming and is benefiting from the strong German economy -- look around and you will see construction everywhere.

Though it shouldn't need to be said, Germans are generally not fans of discussing their history, and experience a "collective guilt" for the things their not-so-distant relatives were a part of. Don't make jokes about it, just let it be.

### See the city

I highly recommend taking a walking tour to see the highlights of the city. My favorite is the [free Sandemans New Europe Walking Tour](http://www.newberlintours.com/daily-tours/free-tour.html). It meets several time a day (currently 10am, 11am, 2pm, and 4pm) at the Starbucks (Americans Assemmmble!!!!) near the Brandenburg Gate. It lasts about 3 hours and the guides are phenomenal. The tour itself costs nothing, though you are encouraged to pay the guide at the end however much you feel the tour was worth.

If you don't want to do an organized walking tour, then I suggest starting at Alexanderplatz, walking down Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag, and then wandering through the Tiergarten.

#### Other Sights

Beyond the normal sights, I enjoy walking through Berlin's diverse neighborhoods. Each has its own population, sights, history, and food. My favorite resources for learning about these are [Slow Travel Berlin](http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/) and [The Needle Guide For Moving to Berlin](http://needleberlin.com/moving-to-berlin-the-needle-guide-2012-edition/).

### Working

Not 100% on vacation? Berlin is home to numerous co-working spaces and cafes. Two of the favorites are [St. Oberholz](http://www.sanktoberholz.de/) and [Betahaus](http://www.betahaus.com). Beyond those, Berlin has cafes everywhere you look, and Wi-Fi (refered to as "WLAN") is usually available.

### Everything else

Well there's a quick overview of what I think is important to get around Berlin. That said, there is so much to do and know about Berlin, that this guide barely skims the surface. There is truly something for everyone, and I suggest reading up on the city before coming here. I'd be happy to make recommendations.

### Standing invitation

If you are coming to UIKonf, or find yourself in Berlin any other time, say hi. I'm always happy to meet up for coffee or beer, show people around the city, or talk about the tech scene here. You can find me on Twitter as [@estromlund](https://twitter.com/estromlund) or send me an email at [erik@erikstromlund.com](mailto:erik@erikstromlund.com).

*Live in Berlin, or fancy yourself an expert? If you have any other suggestions or tips, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/estromlund/estromlund.github.com/pulls) and I'd happily update this guide.*
