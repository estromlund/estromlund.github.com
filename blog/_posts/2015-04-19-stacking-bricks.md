## Getting To Step 2

I've started a blog, I'm pretty sure, about 3 times, and never gotten beyond the first post. Today, one year and two months after the last of these starts, I'm putting that streak to an end.

You see, blogging always sounds like a good idea. I have something to offer the greater internet community, I tell myself. I should market myself, get my name out there, work on becoming "internet famous", and sell product after product after product. Or so I tell myself. But where do I start?

Well, the problem is that I have started several times. I do the easy part and [set up a blog]({% post_url 2014-02-21-first-post %}), write a first post, and thenn...nothing. Basically I do the work until any real effort is required (ok, maybe as a developer my definition of effort is relative), and then I stop.

## Stacking Bricks

Doing the hard part is the important part. But it doesn't always need to be that hard. I have a tendency to build things up, think too much, and eventually over analyze the crap out of something until I ultimately suffer from inaction.

The thing is, once I start doing something, and establish the habit, I am actually pretty good at sticking to it.

### LineUp

I built the first version of my iOS app, [LineUp]({{ page.lineup-url }}), in under 2 months, **while** I was teaching myself iOS and Rails.

But then, after a few more updates and a stable app, I pretty much ignored it for a year.

### Finding Motivation

About 2 months ago, I started reading [Amy Hoy's blog] (https://unicornfree.com), where she speaks about [stacking the bricks](https://unicornfree.com/stacking-the-bricks). Around that time, there was also an [Ask HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8800788) about motivation, where many posted about the idea of simply doing something, *anything*, every day, in order to keep working on projects.

### Falling down the rabbit hole

I decided to give it a shot, and without any grand end goals, gave LineUp some love every day of the week. Some days this meant tweaking some copy. Other days it meant playing with Adwords. Sometimes I would just run `pod update`, or delete dead code.

The thing is, and I think this is a good thing, is that a lot of these days my little contribution ended up leading down a rabbit hole and I would implement entirely new features.

Even in the cases where I did just spend 5 minutes on something, these actions contributed and built upon each other just like compound interest, and got me in a bug-fixing, wanna-be-designer, super-ninja/rockstar developer, or copy-editor mood. Each day got easier and easier, and all of a sudden I had been working on LineUp again for a month straight.

On April 12, I released a new version of [LineUp]({{ page.lineup-url }}) for the first time in about a year. And it paid off! Downloads went up about 40%, and sales about 50%. Now that is motivation to feed on!

## Just Do It

So what's the point? My point is that I need to **Just Do It**. Scratch that, I don't **need** to do anything -- seeing the results makes me **want** to.

I like seeing the results of my work translate directly to more $$ in the bank. I don't miss the stress of knowing that customers have a less-optimal product on their iPhones. I like the pride in completing a project, of scratching off something on my todo list.

Going forward, I'm going to remember to apply these principles to form habits, whether for a side project, working out, or writing:

1. Take the first step. It doesn't have to be anything big, but it's important to do this. Otherwise you can't start!
  - Buy the domain for your blog
  - Write down the ideas in your head
  - Tell someone about your goal
  - Open Xcode/Sublime/RubyMine and create a new project (and don't worry about the name, you can always change it)

1. Do something every day, no matter how small
  - Sketch a new design
  - Research technology choices
  - Just open the project and look at it (if you're like me, you'll at least find some dead code, an extraneous comments to delete, or something that cries "Refactor Me!")

Just taking these 2 steps has done wonders for me. There's no secret to it, just a little bit of **self discipline** and forming habits.
